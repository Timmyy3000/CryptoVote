# CryptoVote

BUCC 2021 Hackathon submission themed around Blockchain. This Decentralized Application facilitates electronic voting systems.

Blockchain technology was first used within Bitcoin and is a public ledger of all transactions. A blockchain stores these transactions in a block, the block eventually becomes completed as more transactions are carried out. Once complete it is then added in a linear, chronological order to the blockchain. A number of digital voting systems are currently in use in countries around the world. And a general trend is developing around the globe, the adoption of electronic voting systems

# CryptoVote is a Decentralized Application (DApp) created on the Ethereum Blockchain that attempts to create a system that doesnâ€™t entirely replace the current voting but rather integrates within an existing secured system, that is the Ethereum Blockchain
